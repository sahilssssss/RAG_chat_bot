Surveillance Measure is an initative by the regulatory bodies and exchanges to protect traders and investors by monitoring price and volatility and detecting misleading activities like insider trading, fictitious transactions, and more. SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) along with the stock exchanges have initiated an Additional Surveillance Measure or ASM to safeguard investors\u2019 interests by ensuring there are no market speculations or manipulations like unexpected price movements. The stocks are categorized under ASM for surveillance based on criteria specified by NSE here. GSM or Graded Surveillance Measure is a system used by Indian Stock Exchanges like NSE and BSE to alert traders/investors and ask them to be extra cautious while dealing in certain securities which have been categorized under GSM. Scrips can be classified under GSM due to abnormal price hike that doesn\u2019t match with the company\u2019s financial health, are illiquid, have negligible market capital, and are underpreforming. The main aim of the ASM framework is to control stock volatility, while the primary objective of GSM is to protect the investors from underperforming stocks by not allowing intraday trading and to advise them to be extra vigilant while dealing with securities that are witnessing unusual price fluctuations. Both these frameworks are introduced with different objectives, but their main goal is to protect traders and investors. SEBI and Exchanges jointly decides the objective criterion to shortlist securities under ASM based on the following parameters:\n1. High Low Variation\n2. Client Concentration\n3. Close to Close Price Variation\n4. Market Capitalization\n5. Volume Variation\n6. Delivery Percentage\n7. No. of Unique PANs & PEs On the basis of below-mentioned pointers, Regulatory Body and the Exchanges make their decision of adding a scrip under GSM category:\n1. Periodic Call Auction Session for Illiquid Securities\n2. Periodic Review of Movement of Securities to/from Trade for Trade\n3. Persistent Noise Creators\n4. Rumour Verification and Clarification in case of Spurt in Price/Volume Every 2 months in the case of ASM and every quarter in the case of GSM, the stock can go in and out of the list based on the review carried out by the exchange. Please find the detailed surveillance measures under ASM here. Our experts will be happy to assist you Still have any queries? Connect with our support team.

Shareholders who own shares of the company on the record date set by the company are eligible for bonus shares. The bonus shares will get credited to your demat account 10-15 days after the record date.\nIn case you do not receive the same post 15 days from the Record date you can check the status with the Registrar (RTA).\nYou can find the details of the Registrar on the BSE India website by visiting the Corp Information section. The buy price of bonus shares is zero, as they are credited at no cost. When the shares are credited to your account, the quantity of shares increases while the invested value remains unaffected. As a result, the average price of the stock reduces. Be assured that it is correctly calculated by Angel One. Our experts will be happy to assist you Still have any queries?

In case you don\u2019t have a UPI ID, you can create it with any of the UPI Handles featured in the NPCI list.\nAlternatively, you can apply through ASBA with your bank or through physical form. You can follow the below steps to create a UPI ID with the BHIM app Download the Google Pay/ PhonePe / BHIM App\nVerify your mobile number\nRegister the passcode (it is required to open the app)\nSelect your bank from the options available\nThe app will fetch your bank details\nIn case you have more than one account, choose the account you want to register with BHIM\nSet up a UPI PIN for security\nNow you can check your UPI ID in the profile section. For IPO applications, only UPI ID/Handles approved by NPCI are allowed.\nIn case you are unable to apply for IPO using your UPI ID/Handle, we recommend that you check the list of banks/apps approved by NPCI for providing UPI service for IPO application. In case you can\u2019t find your UPI Handle in the dropdown list on the IPO page in the Angel One app, it means your UPI Handle is not approved by NPCI for applying for an IPO.\nTry to use or create an alternative UPI ID with any of the entities featured on the NPCI list. Below are a few things you can do: Go to your Payment App \u2013 Navigate to the mandate section and check if you have an open mandate or not.\nIn case you have received many mandates then you can cross verify with the Application ID mentioned in the mandate details with the Application ID mentioned in the order details from Angel One\u2019s Application\nOR\nMake sure your Payments App is updated.\nOR\nIf it is taking longer than 6 hours then cancel your bid from Angel one\u2019s application and place a new bid. You have to approve the IPO mandate request in your UPI app. Pending mandates shall expire after 5 PM on the last day. So users should accept the mandate before 5 PM on the last day to participate in the IPO. With Angel One, there are no charges to apply for an IPO. NRI\u2019s can not apply via the Angel One app.\nHowever, they can apply through the physical ASBA (Application Supported By Blocked Amount) process with your bank. Cut-off price is the price at which the shares get issued through an IPO to the investors.\nThis price is ascertained at the allotment stage.\nWhen an investor applies for an IPO at a cut-off price, that means he is ready to bid at this price.\nIn an ideal scenario, all retail investors bid at the cut-off price to increase their chance of allotment. You can apply for an IPO using any other bank account provided the account is in the name of the investor. It is preferred that you apply using your savings account as most banks do not process IPO applications submitted using a current account.\nYou need to check with your bank for more details. You cannot apply via the Angel One app.\nHowever, you can apply using your HUF account through the physical ASBA process with your bank. The Angel One app doesn\u2019t allow a minor to apply.\nAlthough, a minor can apply via physical ASBA process through your bank. As per the ASBA process, banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO. Once the shares are allotted to you, the amount will be debited from your bank account.\nIf the shares are not allotted to you, the amount will be unblocked/released to your account on/before the UPI mandate expiry date.\nNote: Banks usually take 10-15 days to release your funds.\nIf your funds are still blocked after 15 days please contact your bank . Yes, you can modify the lot size and UPI ID of your IPO bid after placing an order.\nPlease note that if you have approved your UPI mandate request for the order and modified the order later, the entire IPO bid amount will be blocked in addition to the amount blocked for your original IPO bid.\nYou will also receive another UPI mandate request for your modified bid.\nHowever, if you haven\u2019t approved the original mandate request, no amount will be blocked for the original IPO bid. Few of the common reasons your IPO application is rejected You might have entered the wrong UPI ID or UPI PIN while approving the mandate\nEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected because\nJill\u2019s bank account used is not linked to the demat account of Jack\nJill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN Your funds will be blocked once you approve the UPI mandate request for IPO.\nYour funds will be unblocked/released on or before the UPI mandate expiry date if the shares are not allotted through IPO.\nPlease reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked/released post the mandate expiry date. We would like to explain that Angel One is merely a platform to apply for IPO and has no control over its allotment. IPO allotment can never be guaranteed since, in case of over-subscription, the allotment is done via a lottery system. However, you can avoid application rejection by Applying from only 1 Demat account per PAN\nApplying at cut-off price\nEnsuring that the Bank A/c, Demat A/c, and UPI ID are mapped to the same PAN For example: Jack is using Jill\u2019s UPI ID to apply for an IPO with his Demat A/c. In such a case, Jack\u2019s application will be rejected because Jill\u2019s bank A/C used is not linked to the Demat A/c of Jack Jill\u2019s UPI ID used is not linked to Jack\u2019s PAN Banks will simply hold/block your money when you apply for an IPO.\nSo, your funds will be released/unblocked on or before the UPI mandate expiry date.\nPlease reach out to your bank in case funds are not unblocked or released post the mentioned date. Common reasons why you didn\u2019t get the allotment are\nNon-Allotment \u2013 Allotment is done through lottery system because of over-subscription Rejection \u2013 Application can be rejected due to either of the following reasons:\n1) Application received from multiple Demat accounts having the same PAN\n2) Bank account Demat account, and UPI ID used for an application not mapped to the same PAN\n3) Your bid price is lower than the final issue price Tax will be levied on your profit as per your tax bracket. Visit our website https://www.angelone.in/upcoming-IPO to get all information about forthcoming IPO\u2019s. Your UPI mandate request status on the Angel One app does not get updated in real-time.\nIt will reflect shortly in your IPO order book. For an IPO application process in the Angel One app, withdrawing, deleting, and canceling the application is the same thing. Follow the below path to withdraw/cancel your IPO application\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order you wish to cancel\nTap on cancel & confirm to cancel your IPO Order Follow the below path to check your IPO application status\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the application status\nYour IPO application status will be visible from here Follow the below path to check your subscription status\nTap on IPO on the Home page\nClick on IPO orders & click on the IPO Order for which you want to check the subscription status\nYour IPO subscription status will be visible from here Only 1 application per PAN is recommended. Even if you apply via different platforms using the same PAN, your application will be rejected and you will not get the IPO allotment. However, you can increase the chances of IPO allotment by applying with different account linked to different PAN. For example, you can apply with your and your parents demat account separately.

No, your details, including your mobile number, must match those verified by our banking partner. A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank. These permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes. Yes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication. Yes, you can retry. Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication. No, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN. For booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed. The name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN. Aadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request. No, a physical copy is not required. We use secure platforms like DigiLocker and CKYC for verifying your Aadhar and other documents. DigiLocker is a government initiative under the Digital India project for storing and verifying documents like PAN card, driving license, Aadhar card, school marksheets, and insurance papers. For successful FD booking, the name on your Aadhar and PAN should match. Correct the details on either your PAN or Aadhar card and retry. Use the \u201cadd\u201d button on the address choice screen to add an address that is not listed. The address from your Aadhar is considered your permanent address. You may add or select your current address to proceed with the FD application. Yes, you can select your permanent address as your current address if they are the same. Video KYC is required to complete the KYC verification step as mandated by the RBI. If you have made the payment, we will notify you when the bank officers are available. If video KYC is not completed within 3 days, your money will be refunded to your bank account. Video KYC is available from Monday to Saturday, 09:00 AM to 08:00 PM. We will notify you to complete the video KYC during these hours if pending. You can retry during banking hours within 2 days of FD booking if your video KYC fails. Your video KYC details are verified by bank officers, which may take up to 3 hours. Track the video KYC and FD confirmation status on the \u2018My Investments\u2019 tab. Retry using the correct details. If it still doesn\u2019t work, try again later. If the issue persists, raise a ticket with our support team for assistance. These details are required by the bank to create your fixed deposit and ensure communication if needed. Your money is deducted before video KYC as it is the last step to verify your identity and book your FD. Your money is safe with the bank, and interest starts accumulating from the time of payment. In case of issues with VKYC, your money will be refunded within 7 working days. Keep your PAN Card and a blank paper with a pen ready for the VKYC process.

Lenders will send EMI reminders before the due date via call and WhatsApp. No, part prepayment of the loan is not available currently. You can check your payment statement online under the \u2018Loans\u2019 tab. All details for verification, tracking, and managing your loans will be available there once the loan is approved. If you miss or fail to repay your EMIs on the loan, it can negatively affect your credit score and may lead to additional charges or legal action. We strongly urge you to avoid missing your loan monthly installment payments. If your EMI is not cleared from your bank account via the auto debit E-NACH mandate on the due date due to inadvertent circumstances, you can pay it yourself through the Angel One app. Follow these steps: Open the Angel One app. Navigate to the loan pass book. Use the \u201cPay Now\u201d section to make the payment via net banking or debit card. Alternatively, the EMI mandate will be represented for auto debit from your bank account. To foreclose the loan, you can also use the Angel One app to find the option to foreclose and complete the payment using the same methods. Presently, we do not have the feature to facilitate the change of the bank account used to set up the EMI mandate. We urge you to continue servicing your EMI through the bank account that was used at the time of loan disbursement. Your eligibility for foreclosure varies depending on the lender partner. Please check your loan documents for specific details regarding foreclosure eligibility and conditions. Our experts will be happy to assist you Still have any queries? Connect with our support team.
